### Description

This utility allows you to create a keyboard script which, when played, sends keyboard events to your target application as though a human user had. This is a great way to deal with batch processing of tasks that you know are repetitive. It can also be used for scripting demonstrations.

<P>In addition to just sending key combinations, the macro language allows you to pause for user intervention, wait for a number of seconds or milliseconds, insert helpful comments, and so on.

Think of it as application integration scripting.

<P>To make your job easier, you can call up an active "cheat sheet" with all the codes for oddball keys like backspace or print-screen. The program includes a simple but complete (plain text) help file.

<P>And you can save and later reload load your scripts, too.

<P>Your comments are welcome. And if you like this utility, please vote for it. Thanks.
